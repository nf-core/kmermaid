## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility (please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/kmermaid -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
```

> Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

iv. Start running your own analysis!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Update the default command above used to run the pipeline -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/kmermaid -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
